Software Engineer
----------------------

I have always been a geek, interested in gadgets and tech all the time. I also liked biology and health, so after my high school graduation I pursued a career in nursing, after finishing my Nursing Bachelor's Degree I started working in my community hospital, and one of the things that frustrated me at my work was the technology that I was using to take care of my patients, being a geek and tech enthusiast I was always trying to improve ways of interacting with the software and so I did. After 1 year of working as a nurse, I was determined to create better software for nurses to use in the day-to-day, but there was no specialization in the technology field for nurses, so I decided to take a big step and started my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science while working as a nurse full-time, the times where hard but I have managed to get it done in the three years I was supposed to. After finishing this new Bachelor's in Computer Science and being allowed to leave the hospital when the pandemic slowed down, my new home as a new software engineer was at Capgemini Engineering, there I made many friends and learned many things with people who were experienced and with people that were on the same train as me as a newly arrived person to the IT development side, I was able to start my test automation journey working in the automation of set-top boxes, mobile, web, and smart-tv for two big telecom companies which allowed me to gather many experiences that improve quality in so many platforms. I was also able to snatch some knowledge regarding cloud infrastructure for tests like CI/CD pipelines and continuous testing platforms. With all of that, it was time for a new challenge, and so Aubay and Siemens became my new home. I worked with Siemens in testing and improving test automation for two internal Siemens Platforms that allowed users to manage all of their IT solutions and plan and deploy new factories across the world with Siemens machines. Currently, I am at Uphold testing and building the latest and greatest digital assets wallet using Cypress and Detox to improve our automation testing capabilities.
